                            Although photography as a science, technology, art and practice has a history longer than a century in Bangladesh, as a visual-cultural tradition it has not been recognised. In this context, Drik Picture Library in collaboration with Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development and Pathshala â€“ South Asian Media Institute has taken an initiative to document this tradition with a particular focus on history of mofussil (small town) photography in Bangladesh.
